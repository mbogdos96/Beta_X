The NMR spectra are provided as .mnova files and contain the assignment, peak picking, integration and labelling of the authors. FID files can be provided upon request, 
if these are desired email michael_bogdos@hotmail.com with your request.

Files have been named in the following manner:

Reactions with Pd sources - LG(name of X group)L(ligand employed)

Characterisation of organics - PhBr(name of X group)

vTNMR is self explanatory.

OMS solvents = experiments in different solvents

stereochem = stereochemical experiments

Controls = PtBu3 or PPh3 with substrate only
